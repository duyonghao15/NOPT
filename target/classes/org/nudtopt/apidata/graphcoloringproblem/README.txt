Graph colouring
There are 30 test problems.

These test problems are the test problems involving 100 and 300 nodes as in Table 6 of the paper Fleurent C. and Ferland J.A. (1996) Genetic and hybrid algorithms for graph coloring, Annals of Opns Res. 63, 437-461.

These test problems are gcol1, gcol2, ..., gcol30

These test problems are in DIMACS format (e.g. see here for a link to a description of that format) and have been contributed by Dr Bill Dowsland (w.b.dowsland@btconnect.com)
