Bin packing - two dimensional
There are currently 2 data files.

These files contain the instances of the two-dimensional bin packing problem considered in Hopper E. and Turton B. C. H., 2002, "An empirical study of meta-heuristics applied to 2D rectangular bin packing" Special Issue on Cutting, Packing and Knapsacking Problems, Studia Informatica, vol. 2, no. 1. ISBN 2-912590-13-2; ISSN Regular 1625-7545.

The instances concern 2D rectangular bin packing problems with
- items of different size
- objects of different size
No optimal solution is known. The problems have been constructed such that the total area of the items is similar.

The files are an Excel xls file binpacktwo.xls and a PDF file binpacktwo.pdf

The Excel file additionally contains the problem instances from the literature, which have been used in said article for comparison purposes. In contrast to the pdf-file the Excel-file is editable.

These files have been contributed by Eva Hopper (HopperE@gmx.net), to whom any queries should be addressed.

The largest file is binpacktwo.pdf of size 150Kb (approximately).
